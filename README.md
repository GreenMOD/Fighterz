# Fighterz

Fighterz is my first attempt at producing a fighting game and also my first attempt at completing a large project without support. Fighterz is a fighting game that takes inspiration from Dragon Ball FighterZ's auto combos and other games like Mugen in art style. I will be using C# and the Monogame framework. 
My aim for this project is to produce a 1v1 2D fighting game with at least 2 characters to pick from that each have a relatively different move set. I am also using this to learn more about OOP and Monogame. This is a casual side project to put time into when I can.
